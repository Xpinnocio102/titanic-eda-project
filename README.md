# 🧠 Titanic Survival EDA Project

Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic survival dataset using Python, pandas, and seaborn.

## 📋 Overview

This project explores factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. It uses Python, `pandas`, and `seaborn` to analyze and visualize data patterns that may have impacted survival outcomes. The goal was to build analytical confidence through real-world data exploration.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- What % of passengers survived?
- Did gender affect survival rates?
- Did passenger class matter?
- Were younger passengers more likely to survive?
- Did family size influence survival?

---

## 💡 Insights

- Only **38% of passengers survived**, while **62% did not**
- **Women** were significantly more likely to survive than men
- **1st class passengers** had a **63% survival rate** vs only **24% in 3rd class**
- **Children under 10** had noticeably higher survival rates
- **Small families (2–4 members)** had better survival odds compared to solo travelers and large families
