# 🧠 Titanic Survival EDA Project

This project explores factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster using Python, pandas, and seaborn.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- What % of passengers survived?
- Did gender affect survival rates?
- Did passenger class matter?
- Were younger passengers more likely to survive?
- Did family size influence survival?

## 💡 Insights
- Only 38% of passengers survived
- Women and 1st-class passengers had much higher survival rates
- Small families (2–4) had better odds than solo or large-family travelers
- Children under 10 had a clear survival advantage
